here are the exact steps to set everything back up.

1. Re-create the Virtual Environment
Open your terminal in the spark root directory and run:

powershell
# Create the environment
python -m venv .venv
# Activate it
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
2. Re-install Python Dependencies
With the environment activated, install the required libraries:

powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Backend
Start the Flask server:

powershell
# Ensure you are in the root directory
python app.py
4. Run the Frontend
In a second terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder and start the development server:

powershell
cd spark-ai-hub-main
npm install    # (Only if you deleted node_modules too)
npm run dev
